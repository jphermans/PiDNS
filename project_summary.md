# PiDNS Project Summary

## Project Overview

PiDNS is a lightweight DNS and DHCP server solution designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. It includes a web dashboard that allows you to monitor connected devices, view their IP addresses, and see network information in real-time.

## Key Features

- **DNS Server**: Lightweight DNS forwarding with caching
- **DHCP Server**: Automatic IP address assignment for network devices
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of connected devices
- **Device Information**: IP address, MAC address, hostname, vendor, and connection duration
- **Resource Optimized**: Designed specifically for Pi Zero 2 W's limited resources
- **Auto-start**: Services start automatically on boot

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- MicroSD card (16GB+ recommended)
- Power supply (2.5A+ recommended)
- Network connection (Ethernet or Wi-Fi)

### Software
- Debian OS
- Python 3.7+
- dnsmasq
- Flask
- Systemd

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **dnsmasq**: DNS and DHCP server
- **Python 3**: Programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Systemd**: Service management

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Markup language
- **CSS3**: Styling with responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks

### Data Storage
- **dnsmasq lease file**: DHCP lease information
- **JSON file**: MAC vendor database
- **In-memory cache**: Parsed lease data

## Implementation Plan

The project is divided into 12 main tasks, organized into 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (4 hours)
1. Set up project structure and configuration files
2. Create dnsmasq configuration for DNS and DHCP services
3. Implement Flask backend with API endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (6 hours)
1. Implement lease file parsing functionality
2. Add MAC address vendor lookup functionality
3. Implement device connection duration calculation
4. Create HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend dashboard

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (5.5 hours)
1. Add real-time updates to the dashboard
2. Add basic authentication for dashboard access
3. Create systemd service for auto-start on boot

### Phase 4: Finalization (4 hours)
1. Optimize for Pi Zero 2 W resource constraints
2. Create installation and setup documentation

**Total Estimated Time: 19.5 hours**

## Key Design Decisions

### Why dnsmasq?
- Lightweight and efficient, perfect for Pi Zero 2 W's limited resources
- Combined DNS and DHCP server reduces complexity
- Well-documented and widely used
- Simple lease file format for easy parsing

### Why Flask?
- Lightweight web framework
- Easy to implement REST APIs
- Python is already available on Debian
- Low resource usage compared to alternatives

### Why parse lease file directly?
- Simplest approach with no additional configuration needed
- Minimal resource overhead
- Reliable and well-tested method
- No additional dependencies required

## Security Considerations

- Basic authentication for dashboard access
- Restrict dashboard access to local network
- Secure configuration of dnsmasq
- Regular security updates
- Minimal attack surface

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized for Pi Zero 2 W's single-core CPU and 512MB RAM
- Minimal disk I/O operations
- Efficient data structures and algorithms
- Caching strategies to reduce resource usage
- Lightweight frontend with no heavy frameworks

## Future Enhancements

- DNS query logging and visualization
- DHCP reservation management
- Network traffic monitoring
- Mobile app for remote monitoring
- Integration with home automation systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Files Created

1. **architecture.md**: System architecture diagram and component details
2. **implementation_plan.md**: Detailed implementation plan and project structure
3. **task_breakdown.md**: Task breakdown with subtasks and deliverables
4. **task_dependencies.md**: Task dependency diagram and implementation order
5. **project_summary.md**: This summary document

## Next Steps

1. Review the plan and provide feedback
2. Switch to Code mode to begin implementation
3. Start with Task 1: Set up project structure and configuration files

## Questions for Review

1. Are you satisfied with the technology choices (dnsmasq, Flask, vanilla JS)?
2. Does the implementation timeline of approximately 19.5 hours seem reasonable?
3. Are there any additional features you'd like to include in the initial version?
4. Do you have any concerns about the security or performance considerations?
5. Would you like to proceed with the implementation as planned?
